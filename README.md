# Python-Game
General Crossy Road Game using Python code

Using code such as function and while using turtle, I was able to recreate a beginner version of a crossy road series game. 
There are going to be obstacles coming from the right side of the screen and two turtles trying to make their way to the top of the screen. 
# Overview
Game will be a stickman character named Gary riding a turtle named Larry he will move across the X axis, avoiding obstacles while reaching his destination whith a finish line in the great game called TAKE A RIDE.

# Predictions
The predictions of this project will be that we will create a game that where we will have to code one character that will be named Gary and we will have to code things that he will have to manuever around to avoid and if they touch the said object it will have to end the game. The prediction for us is that this will be a difficult game to code and will have to do alot of location tracking for the character. In addition to this with the code we will have to track where these different things will be located where we will have to create barriers to ensure that we can track when they hit the specific area.

# Pseudo Code
# Code Highlights
In player.py and playertwo.py you can see near the bottom the code that was used to incorporate the four movement keys for each character. In main.py is the code used for screen on key code functions that define the key used for each of the functions either up down left or right. We also incorporated a two player game integration by having 8 statements of each throughout two different files(player and playertwo). Also, you can see the position reset code in obstacles.put that defines whenever the turtle reaches the top of the screen, it resets the position back to the bottom and changes the speed of the obstacles to make it a harder level. With this it creates a competitive space that will want people to keep playing the game.

# Implementation and Testing
We will implement the program and test the code and final product until we get what we predict for the future of the game. In terms of testing, we are planning on updating the code every time that we test the game to see what bugs we have in the code. If there are bugs, we will then try and fix them and make the game the best we can with the resources that we have. Through testing, we saw that some things didn't sign with each other like the movement keys or the object speeds or the move increments. Therefore, to fix these bugs in the code, a further look needed to be taken for these multiple functions. We also found that there was some adjustements needed to be made for the obstucles to ensure that the collission would work correctly within the game.

# Summary
The summary of this game will be one chracter will be moving back and forth to avoid obstacles, if someone hits an obstacle the game will end and you will be given a score on how far you have gotten through the game. Through TAKE A RIDE you will be able to enjoy a game where you can move around and avoid things from hitting you while moving a small character through a journey of a lifetime.

# Rules
The rules of the game will be as follows: You must get as far as you can without running into obstacles.
